Welcome to the world of programming with Python. In this homework assignment, you'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete the two Python Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.
Both of these challenges encompass a real-world situation where your newfound Python scripting skills can come in handy. These challenges are far from easy so expect some hard work ahead!

Create a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company that will be provided as data set called [budget_data.csv]. The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.

The Python script will analyze the financial records to calculate each of the following:
  * The total number of months included in the dataset
  * The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * The average change in "Profit/Losses" between months over the entire period
  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyPoll - Background

In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

You will be give a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:


The total number of votes cast


* A complete list of candidates who received votes


* The percentage of votes each candidate won


* The total number of votes each candidate won


* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
