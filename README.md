Welcome to the world of programming with Python. In this homework assignment, you'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete the two Python Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.
Both of these challenges encompass a real-world situation where your newfound Python scripting skills can come in handy. These challenges are far from easy so expect some hard work ahead!

## PyPoll - Background

<p align="justify"> In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

You will be give a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:


The total number of votes cast


* A complete list of candidates who received votes


* The percentage of votes each candidate won


* The total number of votes each candidate won


* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
